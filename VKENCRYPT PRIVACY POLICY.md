VKEncrypt uses permission for changing the content of the website vk.com. This permission is required for displaying controls and changing the content of the encrypted messages to decrypted text.
No personal data is used by this add-on for information gathering, statistics or with any other purpose.
No personal data will be stored by this add-on in browser storage, local file or any other kind of information storage.

VKEncrypt uses the following data for its work:
1. Unique user identifier - Profile link set by user or by the social network as default one (like idXXXXXXXXX). User identifier is used for cryptographic key generation only. Any changes of user unique identifier will cause inability to decrypt any previous messages.
2. Local time of computer/mobile device - amount of milliseconds from 1 January 1970 to the message sending. This value is used both in the cryptographic key generation process and as a part of encrypted message header which will be unencrypted. Any changes to local time can cause inconsistent behaviour of the system of replay attack detection.

This information is used only for add-on functioning.
